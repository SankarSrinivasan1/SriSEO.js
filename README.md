Certainly! In addition to including the "SEOify.js" library as a `<script>` tag in your HTML file, an alternative way to include the library is by using a module bundler like webpack or Rollup. This allows you to leverage the benefits of a module-based development approach and manage your project's dependencies more efficiently.

To include "SEOify.js" using a module bundler, follow these steps:

1. Install the "SEOify.js" library as a dependency in your project using npm or yarn:

   ```bash

   npm install seoify.js

   ```

   or

   ```bash

   yarn add seoify.js

   ```

2. Import the library in your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript

   import SEOify from 'seoify.js';

   ```

   If you're using a specific function from the library, you can import it directly:

   ```javascript

   import { setMetaTags, generateSlug } from 'seoify.js';

   ```

3. Build your JavaScript bundle using the module bundler's configuration. This process may vary depending on the bundler you're using.

   For example, with webpack, you would typically have a configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) where you define the entry point and output configuration:

   ```javascript

   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {

     entry: './src/index.js', // Replace with your entry file

     output: {

       filename: 'bundle.js',

       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Replace with your output directory

     },

   };

   ```

4. Include the generated bundle file (`bundle.js`) in your HTML file:

   ```html

   <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>

   ```

Using a module bundler provides the advantage of optimizing and combining multiple JavaScript files into a single bundle, which can improve loading performance on your website.

Note: Make sure to adjust the paths and file names based on your project's structure and configuration.

Remember to consult the documentation or official resources of your specific module bundler for more detailed instructions on how to include external libraries and build your project.
